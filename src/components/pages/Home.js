          Web Developer, with a marketing and hospitality manager background.
          Full-stack certificate from Columbia University during which I
          developed a comprehensive portfolio. My skillset and experience, put
          me at the forefront to join an engineering team tasked to accomplish
          strategic launches of polished user friendly apps.
          <br />
          Iâ€™ve set sail my own segue from France to the USA, and more recently
          from hospitality, with goals to accomplish this transition towards
          becoming an accomplished Software Engineer.
          <br />
          Having worked in different industries, I have a great ability to
          balance distinct skill sets. I enjoy working in teams, am a great
          listener and communicator, looking to join a team with similar values
          and working on meaningful projects.

            Ambition is my drive, learning new things is my fuel.

          <br />
          During my down time, I like watching documentaries, listening to music
          and baking delicious french sweets!
