          I am a Frontend/Full Stack Web Developer, aiming to combine my
          marketing background with my education from Columbia University
          Bootcamp. My skillset and experience, put me at the forefront to join
          an engineering team tasked to accomplish strategic launches of
          innovative user friendly apps. A recent portfolio will show personal
          and team projects. Iâ€™ve set sail my own segue from France to the USA,
          and more recently from marketing, with goals to accomplish this
          transition towards becoming an accomplished Software Engineer. I love
          working with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures, am a great
          communicator and have exceptional interpersonal skills. During my down
          time, I listen to music and bake french sweets!
